##Mobile Developers at Berkeley
Pokedex is a searching device for specific pokemons based on user input filters. Users can set up filters for the type and attributes of pokemon they wish to see. Each pokemon is listed through a table and grid view as well as a detailed profile page.

# Search
Users are prompted to list out filters in types and/or attributes to start search
